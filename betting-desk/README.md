# Betting Desk

A local research tool. It pulls schedules and context free from ESPN, pulls
odds from The Odds API, strips the vig off every market, and tells you where
FanDuel or DraftKings are pricing something above or below fair value.

It does not place bets. It has no account access. It never will.

## Run it in two minutes

```bash
cd betting-desk
cp .env.example .env
# demo mode needs no key at all:
echo "DEMO_MODE=1" >> .env
./run.sh
```

Open <http://127.0.0.1:8000>. Hit **Refresh board**. You'll see three MLB games
with four books apiece, priced off frozen fixture data from Sep 15 2026.

When you're ready for live data, get a key at <https://the-odds-api.com>
(free tier is 500 credits a month), put it in `.env` as `ODDS_API_KEY`, and set
`DEMO_MODE=0`.

API explorer lives at <http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs>.

```

### The math

- **De-vig**: three methods. Default is **power** (solve for *k* where
  `sum(p**k) = 1`). Multiplicative is the common one but it distorts lopsided
  markets, which is exactly where longshot props live. Switch in the UI and
  watch the fair price move — the difference on a heavy favourite is real.
- **Hold** is `1 - 1/overround`, the number books actually quote. A -110/-110
  market holds **4.545%**, not 4.76%. Those are different quantities and
  conflating them overstates the margin on every market.
- **EV** is reported in dollars at your stake, not just percentages.
- **Kelly** is computed full, displayed quarter. Full Kelly is only correct
  if your probability estimate is exact, which it never is.

### Where "fair value" comes from

In priority order:

1. **A sharp book**, if your feed has one. Set `SHARP_BOOK=pinnacle`. One
   sharp de-vigged line beats an average of soft books. The Odds API does not
   carry Pinnacle; SportsGameOdds ($99/mo) does.
2. **A consensus** of every book in the feed, *excluding the book you're
   grading*, so it isn't marking its own homework. Needs 3+ books.
3. **A single book**, labelled as such so you know the number is weak.

Every market reports which of these it used, in `fair_source`. If it says
`single book:fanduel`, treat the edge as noise.

## The cost model — read this before you burn the month

The Odds API charges **markets × regions** credits per call, not one.

| Call | Cost |
|---|---|
| `/sports` | free |
| `/events` | free |
| Game lines, 3 markets, 1 region | 3 credits |
| Game lines, 3 markets, scoped to 2 books | 3 credits |
| Props, 5 markets, one game | 5 credits |
| Props, 5 markets, 15-game slate | **75 credits** |

The free tier is 500 credits a month. That's about six full prop refreshes on
an MLB slate, and nothing else. Two defences are built in:

- `CACHE_TTL` (default 120s) — repeat refreshes inside the window are free
- Scope to `bookmakers` instead of `regions` where you can
- The UI shows `credits_remaining` after every refresh

Pull props per game, when you're actually looking at that game. Not across a
slate out of curiosity.

## Design rules the code actually enforces

**A number is either sourced or absent.** If a book doesn't quote a market,
the cell is `null`. Nothing is filled from a neighbouring book, an average,
or a previous refresh. The UI renders a dash.

**EV is never guessed.** `POST /api/parlay` returns `ev_dollars: null` if any
leg lacks a fair probability, with a note saying so. It does not substitute
the book's own implied probability and call the result EV — that always
returns zero and is worse than saying nothing.

**Same-game parlays get flagged.** The independence math overstates them
because same-game legs are correlated. `same_game: true` and a note say so
rather than letting a confident wrong number stand.

**The slip shows what the same money does as singles.** Same total risk,
split across the legs. It is usually the better number, and seeing it next to
the parlay EV is the point.

---

## What this cannot do

- **Hard Rock is not in The Odds API.** You'll be comparing FanDuel and
  DraftKings against a consensus, then deciding for yourself whether Hard
  Rock's number beats it. That last step stays manual.
- No live in-play odds on the free tier.
- No account access at any book. No balance, no placing, no cancelling.
- Edges found here are small and depend entirely on the quality of the fair
  estimate. Without a sharp anchor, a "consensus" of soft books that all copy
  each other is worth less than it looks.

---

## Next things worth building

1. **Bet log with closing-line value.** Record every bet and the closing
   price, then compare. CLV is the only fast feedback on whether your process
   works — win rate takes hundreds of bets to say anything.
2. **Line-movement history.** Snapshot the board on a schedule, store it, and
   you can see steam moves instead of guessing.
3. **A real database.** SQLite is plenty. Right now nothing persists.
4. **Deploy it.** Railway or Render, free tier, keeps the key server-side.

## Tests

```bash
python3 tests/test_math.py   # 46 assertions on the arithmetic
python3 tests/test_e2e.py    # board build against Odds-API-shaped fixtures
```

Both run offline with no dependencies. The math tests include known-value
checks: two -110 legs price to +264, a -110/-110 market holds 4.545%, and EV
at the breakeven probability is exactly zero.
